# Ninja Clicker

---

For our BeCode training we had to make a cookie clicker in team of three.

The theme of our cookie clicker is the ninja turtles. You are a ninja in New York City and need to practice your ninja moves as much as possible by clicking the ninja. This gives you the opportunity to earn ninjas and be able to get the help of your favourite ninja turtle.

If you're a dedicated ninja, you'll see a shuriken spawning. Click on it and all your clicks will be doubled for 30 seconds.
