# Ninja Clicker

For my BeCode training I had to make a cookie clicker, the theme is The Ninja Turtles.

You are a ninja in New York City and need to practice your ninja moves as much as possible by clicking the ninja. This gives you the opportunity to earn ninjas and be able to get the help of your favourite Ninja Turtle character. If you're a dedicated ninja, you'll see a shuriken spawning: click on it and all your clicks will be doubled for 30 seconds!

## See It Live

You can play the game [here](https://louisevst.github.io/cookie-clicker/)!

Have fun!

## Develop

### Website

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev` starts a local development server that automatically reloads the front-end and scripts.
3. `npm run build` compiles the project in `dist` folder.

- `npm run pages` deploys the website `dist` folder on GitHub Pages.

### Server

- `cd /server/` to install dependencies
- Same three steps as Website
